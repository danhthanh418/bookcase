# [WIP] bookcase ðŸ“š ðŸ¤“
Toy project for experimenting with different React Native libraries.

### Installation

The project was created with `create-react-native-app`. Use `npm start` from the `frontend/`
folder to start the development server. This will print a QR code and the instructions
in the terminal for scanning it with the Expo app.

More detailed instructions can be found in [frontend/README.md](./frontend/README.md)
